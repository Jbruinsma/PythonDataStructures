# Python Data Structures

This project is a collection of core data structures implemented from scratch in Python. The goal is to understand the inner workings of these structures and demonstrate proficiency with common operations, algorithms, and performance considerations.

## Data Structures Implemented

- **Arrays**  
  Dynamic array implementation with append, remove, insert, and resizing.

- **Linked Lists**  
  Singly and doubly linked lists with insert, delete, search, and traversal.

- **Stacks**  
  Array-based and linked list-based stack implementations with push, pop, and peek.

- **Queues**  
  FIFO queue using lists and linked lists.

- **Hash Tables**  
  Custom hash table with basic collision handling via chaining.

- **Heaps**  
  Min-heap and max-heap using array-based binary heap structure.

- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**  
  Includes insert, delete, search, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order).

- **Expression Trees**  
  Binary tree implementation for expression evaluation and conversion.

- **AVL Trees**  
  Self-balancing binary search tree implementation with rotation logic.

- **Sorting Algorithms**  
  Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

- **Searching Algorithms**  
  Linear Search and Binary Search.

## Features

- Unit tests and example usage scripts are included for most structures.
